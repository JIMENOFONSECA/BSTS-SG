 Bayesian Structural Timeseries Model for the Causal Impact Analysis of Behavioral 
 Interventions on Energy Consumption in Singapore
 
 ## How does it work

 This is an ensemble model combining multi-physics and data-driven building energy consumption models
 into a Bayesian Structural Timeseries Model.

## FAQ

- Where are the results stored? A: the results are inside the results folder / final_results.csv
- Where is the raw observed data? A: It is propriety. Hourly weather observations were purchased from [`NEA`](https://www.nea.gov.sg/weather), daily electricity consumption was directly obtained via the REST API of the manufacturer [`SMAPEE`](https://smappee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVAPI/overview).
- Where is the raw synthetic data? A: It is open-source. GIS and BIM data is obatined with the open-source software [`City Energy Analyst`](https://cityenergyanalyst.com/)
